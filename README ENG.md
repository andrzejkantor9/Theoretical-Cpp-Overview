# Theoretical-Cpp-Overview readme eng
introduction:
Project was created using Visual Studio 2015 Express and C++ language. It is actually more about code and comments themselves rather than project functionality. In code I've  used and documented most of common and some advanced C++ syntax as well as writing down some theoretical concepts. What I had in mind while writing it was to: understand C++ syntax along with details, try it myself and to have my own "mini-documentation" I can refer to if I need. Although I didn't finish it since the more I was dooing it the more I understood this isn't very efficient way to learn programming in C++ and that there is so much into C++ that trying to learn it all in theory first does not serve this purpose.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax in code:
C++ 11: inline namespace, class enumerations, rvalue references, nullptr, constexpr

OOP: concrete classes, abstract classes, classes hiierarchy, class elements access, inheritance, operator overloading, friend classes, constant functions, virtual functions, static elements, nested classes, destructors

Other: macros, pointers, lvalue references, enumerations, basic memory management concepts, structures and unions, ASCII, constants, casting, C style arrays
